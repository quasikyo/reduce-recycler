## FAQ

#### Does the time added to the run timer reflect any equipment cooldown (fuel cells, Gesture)?
Yes.

#### Does the config option work in stages without a teleporter (Hidden Realms, Commencement)?
No.

#### If I have multiple fuel cells, will the mod only activate when the last charge is used?
No, it will activate whenever the Recycler is used. The exception to this is expending charges for fuel cells no longer in the player's inventory.
